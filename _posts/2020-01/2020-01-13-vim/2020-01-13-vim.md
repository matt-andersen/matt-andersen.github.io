Today was my first look at Vim and I can see why it is so powerful. I will probably add a course on Vim at some point but for the time being I don't want to get too sidetracked. The rest of today's focus was on scripting.

- Shell scripting:

  - `#!/bin/bash`: Defines the interpreter to be used by the shell script and is placed at the top of the script file.

  - `PATH=$PATH:<directory>`: Appends a new directory to the PATH variable. This allows you to run scripts in this location regardless of your working directory.

  - `chmod +x <script>`: Sets permissions for a script to be executable.

  - `head/tail -n 100`: Outputs the first (head) or the last (tail) 100 lines of a file. Without the `n` option, this command will output the first/last 10 lines.

After a long weekend, I am back on the Linux Academy training courses. Wrapping up _Docker Quick Start_ and starting on _Docker Deep Dive_.

I have set up a server hosted on Linux Academy and I am ssh-ing into it. This will allow me to keep a consistent environment regardless of what computer I am using. I also wrote a [Bash script](https://github.com/matt-andersen/handy-scripts) that automates the set up of a new (Fedora) VPC.

- `docker volume create <volume name>`: Creates a volume. Volumes can be used to persist data outside of the container lifecycle.

There weren't many notes for today. The *Docker Deep Dive* course moved pretty fast and I was more concerned with trying to keep up with the examples as opposed to jotting down notes.

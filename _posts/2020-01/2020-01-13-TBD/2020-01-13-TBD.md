- Shell scripting:

  - `#!/bin/bash`: Defines the interpreter to be used by the shell script and is placed at the top of the script file.

  - `PATH=$PATH:<directory>`: Appends a new directory to the PATH variable. This allows you to run scripts in this location regardless of your working directory.

  - `chmod +x <script>`: Sets permissions for a script to be executable.

> *"An investment in knowledge pays the best interest"* --Ben Franklin

If 2019 taught me anything, it's that education doesn't stop after you finish high school and university. It doesn't finish when you get that degree. And there definitely isn't an age limit on education, it's a life-long pursuit.

I have created this blog for myself as much as anyone reading it. I believe journaling is the ultimate companion in any undertaking. I've found it to be an incredible tool for consistency and has allowed me to flesh out ideas and help with roadblocks. My goal behind this blog is for it to encourage me to make at least one commit/post a day. Software engineering is a skill, no different than learning to play piano or kick a football. It takes a little bit of practice each day. Even an hour or thirty minutes a day might not seem like much, but like compound interest, it snowballs over time.

Okay enough talking, here is what my learning tree looks like. Please note that it is fluid and will change over time. I have a current focus in DevOps tools and methodologies. But I have tried to select courses and readings that will help me no matter where I take my career in tech, such as git, AWS, and Linux.

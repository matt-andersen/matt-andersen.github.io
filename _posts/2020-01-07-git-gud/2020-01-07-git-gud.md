Back on the Linux Academy courses again today, specifically the Source Control with Git course. Below are some useful commands I learnt from today: 

- `git tag`: Used to label points in a repositories history which are considered important. But it's typically used to signify releases.
- `git rebase`: This was a big one for me, I had heard of rebase before but didn't know what it meant. This [article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) via Atlassian outlines the differences between merge and rebase very well. 

- `git revert HEAD`: Undos the last commit that was created. It doesn't go back in time per se, but creates a new commit with information from the previous commit. Prefixing the command with a ~ and a number, specifies how far back in the commit history to go. For example `git revert HEAD~2` would go back 2 commits.

- `git diff`: Shows the difference between two points in the git commit history. A summarised version can be achieved using the --summary option.

- `git gc`: This refers to git's garbage collection which remove objects from the database which can no longer be accessed. Git does it's own garbage collection after a while, so I don't think this is something I'll use often but is still worth noting.

- `git log`: I thought this was very powerful. The `--graph` option shows thegit history in a nice visual format. The `--since` option can show the git history since a period of time, for example `git log --since="2 hours ago"`. The `-S` option allows you to search via a phrase in the history of commits.

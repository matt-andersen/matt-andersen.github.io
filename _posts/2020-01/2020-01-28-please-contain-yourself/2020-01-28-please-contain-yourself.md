After a long weekend, I am back on the Linux Academy training courses. Wrapping up _Docker Quick Start_ and starting on _Docker - Deep Dive_.

I have set up a server hosted on Linux Academy and I am ssh-ing into it. This will allow me to keep a consistent environment regardless of what computer I am using. I also wrote a [Bash script](https://github.com/matt-andersen/handy-scripts) that automates the set up of a new (Fedora) VPC.

- `docker volume create <volume name>`: Creates a volume. Volumes can be used to persist data outside of the container lifecycle.

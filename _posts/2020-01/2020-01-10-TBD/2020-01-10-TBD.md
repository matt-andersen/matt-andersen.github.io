I just realised, yesterday marked a 7 day streak of making at least one commit per day! Which is currently the longest streak on my GitHub profile.

Today I am back on the _LPI Linux Essentials Certification_ course. I am not sure whether or not I will take the certification course itself, but this is something I'll look into in the future. For this course, I have been using Fedora 31 running through VirtualBox. I realised I missed some practicals from yesterday, so I have gone back to complete them. Below are some notes from today:

- `lsb_release -a`: Shows the current distro, version, and release number.

- `cat /etc/*release*`: Used to display release files. The asterisks make use of a feature called _globbing_ which searches for every file containing "release". More on globbing [here](https://linuxhint.com/bash_globbing_tutorial/).

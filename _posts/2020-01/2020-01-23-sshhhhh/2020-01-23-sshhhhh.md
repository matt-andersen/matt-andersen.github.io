I've skimmed through the first 60% of the Python course, which focused on basic programming. The remainder of the Python course revolves around web development. I would like to come back to this at a later date, but for the time being I'd rather focus more so on technologies I am not familiar with.

Today

`ssh-copy-id <hostname>`: Copies public key from your current user to the hostname. This allows you to ssh without typing a password each time.

`ansible-doc <module name>`: Shows documentation for modules within the terminal.

`ansible <hostname> -m setup`: Prints setup information of the supplied hostname. Useful for determining whether or not you have set up the host properly.

`ansible <hostname> -m ping`: Pings the supplied hostname.

`ansible <hostname> -b -m yum -a "name=<package name> state=latest"`: Uses yum to install a package on the provided host. Note that the `-b` flag runs the command with elevated privilege, which is necessary when installing software.
